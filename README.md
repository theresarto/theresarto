# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Theresa (@theresarto)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **backend software development** and **process automation**, with a focus on creating solutions that streamline workflows and enhance user experiences. Here's a bit about me:

## About Me

- **Career Journey**: I discovered coding while working as an eCommerce strategic business oeprations manager. I find ways to make plans happen, and solve bottlenecks where I feel it could be improved. I love automation and cutting down time spent in doing mundane things. I'm also a business economics major, worked in marketing, am a licensed landscape architect (ðŸ™ƒ), and an overall logical thinker that likes putting small details together to form a clearer big picture.

## Current Project: Project Meta TaskWave

Iâ€™m currently developing Meta Taskwave, a rigorous serverless FaaS simulation platform designed to benchmark diverse invocation patterns and analyse how scheduling algorithms affect system-wide processing times.

This project includes:
	-	Building a custom client-server architecture using low-level socket programming for job dispatch and coordination
	-	Implementing a hybrid scheduling framework with 15 algorithm combinations, spanning both job selection and worker allocation strategies
  - Creating a thorough benchmarking process that allowed me to collect 5-10 trials across 15 algorithms under three different workload types
  - Statistical evaluation and testing using CV, ANOVA, Chi-Square Testing, Cramer's V, Standardised Residuals, and Churn Analysis to assess algorithm influence over serverless systems.
	-	Integrating machine learning techniques to adaptively tune parameters based on changing job and worker characteristics in homogeneous environments

Meta Taskwave reflects my commitment to building practical, research-driven solutions that enhance system efficiency, adaptability, and scalability. Iâ€™m excited to keep pushing its capabilities forward.

## Things I've done for fun that are not on GitHub
- Create a Python program that runs through the EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 Annexes and parses against client ingredients lists to flag any restricted or banned ingredients. This is a one of a kind client offering I've developed to ensure full UK and EU compliancy on all our imports.
- Created a Python program that feeds eBay and Amazon sales data for my eCommerce business and turns it into a unified profit-loss data sheet.
- Created a web scraping application that speeds up listing repetitive restocks by providing invoices from the business suppliers.
