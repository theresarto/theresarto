# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Theresa (@theresarto)

Iâ€™m passionate about backend software development and process automation, creating solutions that streamline workflows and improve efficiency.

## About Me

I started coding while working as an eCommerce strategic operations manager, where I automated repetitive processes and solved operational bottlenecks.

Iâ€™m now completing my MSc in Computer Science (with a background in business economics and landscape architecture), blending analytical thinking with technical problem-solving.

## Current Project: Project Meta TaskWave

A transparent benchmarking framework for evaluating hybrid scheduling strategies in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) environments, providing systematic insights into algorithm performance trade-offs.

**Key features:**
- **Hybrid scheduling evaluation:** 15 algorithm combinations (3 job-side Ã— 5 worker-side) with systematic performance analysis
- **Thermal efficiency metric:** Novel performance measurement approach for FaaS workload characterisation
- **Comprehensive benchmarking:** 109,568+ jobs analysed across multiple workload intensities with statistical validation
- **Research-backed insights:** Container lifecycle dominance identified, worker algorithm significance quantified (CramÃ©r's V = 0.33)
- **Open-source foundation:** Reproducible methodology for meta-scheduling research and adaptive algorithm selection
- **Performance transparency:** Statistical analysis revealing 98% of variation attributed to penalty patterns, not algorithm choice

Meta TaskWave demonstrates that systematic evaluation beats black-box optimisation, providing the foundation for future adaptive meta-scheduling through transparent algorithm selection based on workload characteristics.
