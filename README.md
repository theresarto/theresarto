# 👋 Hi, I’m Theresa (@theresarto)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **backend software development** and **process automation**, with a focus on creating solutions that streamline workflows and enhance user experiences. Here's a bit about me:

## 🚀 About Me

- **👩‍💻 Career Journey**: I discovered coding while working as an eCommerce business operations and marketing manager, seeking to automate repetitive tasks and improve business processes. Since then, I've developed a deep interest in programming and problem-solving.
- **🎯 Interests**: Backend development, automation, and building tools to improve workflow.

## 🔥 Current Project: Taskwave

I'm currently working on **Taskwave**, a scheduling system designed to handle efficient job allocation and processing. This project involves:

- Developing a client-server communication system using **socket programming**.
- Creating a 15 scheduling hybrid algorithsm  based on a **job** and **worker selection** matrix to compare performance.
- Use **machine learning** to determine adaptive parameters based on changes in homogeneous job and worker characteristics.

Taskwave represents my passion for creating practical and innovative solutions that improve efficiency and scalability, and I'm excited to continue expanding its functionality.

## 💡 Things I've done for fun that are not on GitHub due to privacy matters
- Create a Python program that runs through the EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 Annexes and parses against client ingredients lists to flag any restricted or banned ingredients. This is a one of a kind client offering I've developed to ensure full UK and EU compliancy on all our imports.
- Created a Python program that feeds eBay and Amazon sales data for my eCommerce business and turns it into a unified profit-loss data sheet.
- Created a web scraping application that speeds up listing repetitive restocks by providing invoices from the business suppliers.
